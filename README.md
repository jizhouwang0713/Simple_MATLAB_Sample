# Simple_MATLAB_Sample
This repo contains several short pieces of MATLAB code for two undergraduate courses in basic numerical analysis and optimization.

## "Jacobi's Method.m"
This code computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix using Jacobi's Method. The code is applied to matrices of dimensionalities 10, 20, 40, with ij-entries given by
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Bequation*%7D%20A_%7Bij%7D%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7Bi%5E2%20&plus;%20j%5E2%7D%20%5Cend%7Bequation*%7D).

## "Steepest Descent and Newton.m"
This code implements the Steepest Descent Algorithm and Newton's Method for Multivariate Functions (both with backtracking line search) for a specific multivariate function. Then we vary some of the parameters to investigate how the rate of convergence depends on the parameters. Multiple plots are presented.

## "Newton's Method.m"
This code uses Newton's Method to compute the inverse of an invertible matrix. We check the accuracy of our implementation by computing the forward and backward errors.
